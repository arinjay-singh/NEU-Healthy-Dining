    "## Motivation ##\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Problem ###\n",
    "With dining halls, the seemingly unlimited food makes it hard for students to make healthy choices. Further, the lack of nutritional information could missinform students about how healthy they are actually eating. High fat/oil foods in the dining hall are known to cause upset stomachs. I struggled with this myself, and was forced to manually search the page for low fat, high protein options. An individual should never have to struggle this hard to find healthy, filling foods.\n",
    "### Solution ###\n",
    "Determining the healthy choices a student can make prior to a trip to the dining hall will make it easier for students to make healthy desisions and feel better. **The goal of this project is to utilize the \"Dine in on campus\" website to determine healthy options for students in the dining halls**\n",
    "### Impact ###\n",
    "If this project is succesfull, it will significantly help students struggling with their weight (freshman 15, for example), or students with dietary restrictions or sensative stomachs, find amazing healthy foods in the dining halls of northeastern. Because \"What's on the menu\" is a service used by many other college dining halls, this project is also very expandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible negative effect that could result from this project, like all campaigns for healthy eating, could be the contribution to body dysmorphia and certain eating disorders an individual could experience. I hope to minimize this as much as possible by prioritizing foods that have good caloric ratios, meaning that their calorie to protein ratio is low."
