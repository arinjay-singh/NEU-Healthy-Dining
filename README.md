Estimating the "healthiness" of dining hall food at Northeastern University for the final project of my Intermediate Programming with Data course. In the context of this project, the "healthiness" of a food item is determined by its Nutri-Score, a score generated by a nutritional rating system that has been recommended by European Union countries as well as the European Commission and the World Health Organization. A Random Forest Regressor machine learning model was trained and tested on a large dataset of food items with assigned Nutri-Scores and then used to predict the Nutri-Scores of Northeastern dining hall food items based on their nutrition information.
